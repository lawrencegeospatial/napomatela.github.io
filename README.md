My personal website
I am a Water resources modeler and GIS enthusiast based in Lesotho. My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing, Hydraulics and hydrologic modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g.Earth Engine, Planetary Computer) to study hydrological change, especially surface water and groundwater inundation dynamics. I am a strong advocate for open and free science and reproducible research.
